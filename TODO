Things to do:

* Extend edit() to add ability to process strings, not just files.
* Extend prep() to read edit sets from files.
* Add function to save edit sets to a file. (i.e. Data::Dump )
* prep() should return information which can locate edit set components.
* Add method to delete edit set components using return value from prep().
* Obtain string which would be eval()ed by edit(), to save or export it.
* Invoke script as separate process to enable use of 'inplace' editing.
* Provide reverse contexts, which match anywhere except within the context.
