INTRODUCTION

This is the README file for the PERL module Text::ASED

Text::ASED is avaiable for download at www.CPAN.org under the Text
category or under the CPAN author ID: TDL

I use Perl version 5.005.62; Text::ASED should work with earlier versions, but I haven't tried it, so I don't know.

WHAT IS Text::ASED?

Text::ASED provides a different interface to the standard Perl regexp
commands. There is nothing you can do using Text::ASED which you
cannot do using pure Perl. Quite the contrary, there are some things
which are difficult or impossible to achieve using text::ASED, though
over time I hope to extend what is possible.

Instead, Text::ASED makes it easier to encapsulate and abstract the
file editing components of a script, simplifying the process of
declaring the changes to perform in a configuration section at the top
of a script or in a separate file. This also assists localization and
internationalization, since the code itself is unchanged, only the
configuration section or the external file is modified.

After installation, you should be able to see the brief documentation
by typing "man Text::ASED" You will now be able to access the
Text::ASED methods by adding "use Text::ASED" at the beginning of your
PERL program.

DOCUMENTATION

POD documentation is provided in the file Text::ASED.pm. After installation, this becomes available as a man page, text::ASED.

Examples of use are included in the test files, under the t/ subdirectory.
